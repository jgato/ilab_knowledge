# ilab_knowledge
Just compiling some docs to create kwnoledge to play with instructlab

In some cases I will just take some blogs, or doc and reformat it as Markdown. That seems to be the format used to add knowledge and generate syntetic data.

I will try to point to original sources if possible. I dont intent to get attribution on the content of this repo, as I said, mainly reformated content for playing.
